# pasankavinga/text-similarity

Lightweight TF-only cosine similarity + evidence snippet helper.

## Why TF-only?
This library intentionally avoids IDF/embeddings to keep behavior simple, deterministic, and explainable for baseline ATS demos.

## Install
```bash
composer require pasanks/text-similarity
